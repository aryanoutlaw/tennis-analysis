# Tennis-Analysis


A Tennis analysis project that leverages advanced deep learning and computer vision techniques to analyze tennis gameplay. This project detects players and the tennis ball using YOLO and utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to extract court keypoints using Pytorch. It measures player speed, ball shot speed, and the number of shots, making it an excellent project for honing my machine learning and computer vision skills.

##Features

Player and Ball Detection: Utilizes YOLO for real-time detection of players and the tennis ball.
Court Keypoints Extraction: Uses CNNs with Pytorch to extract keypoints on the tennis court.
Speed Measurement: Calculates the speed of the players and the ball.
Shot Counting: Counts the number of shots played by each player.
